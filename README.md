# CSE218 Repository

This repo contains code from my CSE218-Data Structures and Algorithms class at SCC College in Fall 2022. Topics mainly included from lecture and homework code were data structures such as Linked Lists, Queues, Stacks, BS Trees, etc. The data stuctures were implemented both with Java API's and from scratch. Also included was sorting algorithms such as Quick Sort and Merge Sort, Recursion, GUI, and Generics.


## Topics/Code Included:

* Big O Complexity
* Data Structures:
    * Stacks
    * Queues
    * Priority Queues
    * Linked Lists(Simple and Doubly Linked)
    * Binary Search Tree
    * Heaps(discussed, not implemented)
* Sorting Algos:
    * Merge/Merge Sort
    * Partition/Quick Sort
    * Heap Sort, Radix Sort, Shell Sort(Not implemented with code, just discussed)
* Generics:
    * Generic Methods
    * Generic Classes
 * Recursion/Recursive Methods
 * GUI Implementation(With JavaFX/SceneBuilder)






## Class Syllabus
* Analyze the efficiency of recursive algorithms.
* Assess the appropriateness of using recursion to solve a given problem.
* Compare and contrast a range of searching and sorting algorithms and analyze time and space efficiencies.
* Create effective, efficient and secure software, reflecting standard principles of software engineering and software assurance.
* Design and construct programming solutions using a variety of recursive techniques.
* Design and develop reusable software using appropriate data structures and templates.
* Practice the tenets of ethics and professional behavior promoted by computing societies; accept the professional responsibilities and liabilities associated with software development.
* Use standard analysis and design techniques to produce a team-developed, medium-sized, secure software application that is fully implemented and formally tested.
